# Game Simulation capstone class spring 2019: [Isle of Magmies](https://github.com/DerekAlexander/Unity-Games/tree/master/GameSim2019)

In a team of seventeen we came up with our own game idea and developed it over a semester using unity as our game engine. In the class I was one of the two programmers my focus was on the interaction systems between the player and our AI. I also handled the request from the artists on making their models, textures and animations look how they wanted in the game engine.

Here is a video showing off some of the game.
