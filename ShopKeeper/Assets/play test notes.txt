helemet name issue / reaper :FIXED

controls while playing based on button :FIXED 
currency text :FIXED
though chest was trash
stay zoom says good management mechanic has to talk to people
shop displays is a shop
button inventory not key based

---------------------------------------------

button hover on gameplay should stop when not hovering

place from distance

clicked on npc to sell

try to drag and drop onto spot

text behind windows :FXIEDISH

missing point loses interest after reaching goal number/ missing fun. niche issue?

item stacking (possible to do with an int itemstacknum? )

npc poof not leaving gracefully

lower timer 

** maybe endless mode.

--------------------------------------------------

uses chest for storage

wanted to go right

npc poof

table collider needed

chest collide



BY IMPORTANCE:
1. controls on game screen accessable at all times by button. : DONE
2. info screen has screenshot with drawings to show game play loop/ how to play 
3. timer settings choosen before play. effects how much money is needed. 
4. text at top of inventory and store menu declaring what they are. : DONE
5. would like to have item switching. possible to leave as is as a mechanic.
6. chest needs collider and probably a use case. *either trash can. *maybe sell back at 75% of buy cost. : DONE USED CARDBOARD BOX
7. maybe table colliders.
